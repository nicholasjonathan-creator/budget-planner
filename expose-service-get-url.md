🌐 SERVICE NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED - GET PUBLIC URL
==============================================

## 🔍 ISSUE IDENTIFIED: "Unexposed service"

Perfect! I can see your deployment is **ACTIVE** and **successful**, but it shows "**Unexposed service**" which means:
- ✅ Your backend is running successfully
- ❌ But it doesn't have a public URL yet
- 🔧 We need to expose it to get a public URL

## 🚀 HOW TO EXPOSE YOUR SERVICE (Get Public URL):

### Option 1: Auto-Expose (Most Common)
**Sometimes Railway auto-exposes services. Let's check:**
1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Look for a public URL** to appear

### Option 2: Manual Domain Assignment
**If no URL appears, we need to add a domain:**
1. **Look for "Add Domain" or "Generate Domain" button**
2. **OR go to Settings tab** → Look for "Domain" section
3. **Add a Railway domain** (they provide free subdomains)

### Option 3: Networking Tab Check
**Let's check the networking configuration:**
1. **Click on the networking icon** (I see `asia-southeast1-gqsqga` in your screenshot)
2. **Look for domain/URL settings there**

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

### Step 1: Check Settings Tab for Domain
1. **Click "Settings" tab**
2. **Scroll down and look for "Networking" or "Domain" section**
3. **Look for "Add Domain" or "Generate Domain" button**

### Step 2: If No Domain Option in Settings
**Tell me what you see in Settings** - I'll guide you to the right place

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

In Settings tab, look for sections like:
- **"Custom Domain"**
- **"Public Networking"**  
- **"Generate Domain"** button
- **"Add Railway Domain"** option

## 🎯 NEXT STEP:

**Go to Settings tab and look for domain/networking options, then tell me:**
- **"I see a Generate Domain button"** - Click it!
- **"I see Custom Domain section"** - We'll add a Railway domain
- **"I don't see any domain options"** - I'll help you find another way

**Click on Settings tab and look for domain options! 🌐**
