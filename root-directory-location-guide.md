üìç WHERE TO FIND "ROOT DIRECTORY" IN RAILWAY
==========================================

## üîç ROOT DIRECTORY SETTING LOCATION:

The "Root Directory" setting appears **AFTER** you create the service, not during initial creation.

## üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

### Step 1: Create Frontend Service First
1. **Click "New Service" or "Add Service"**
2. **Choose "GitHub Repo"**
3. **Select your budget-planner repository**
4. **Let Railway create the service** (it will auto-detect as Node.js/React)

### Step 2: THEN Configure Root Directory
**After the service is created:**
1. **Click on the new frontend service**
2. **Go to "Settings" tab**
3. **Look for "Source" section**
4. **Find "Root Directory" field**
5. **Set it to:** `frontend`

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE: Set During Service Creation

**Some Railway interfaces show Root Directory during creation:**
- Look for **"Advanced Options"** or **"Show More"**
- Look for **"Source Settings"** section
- Look for **"Root Directory"** field during setup

## üìç EXACT LOCATIONS TO CHECK:

### Location A: During Service Creation
- After selecting GitHub repo
- Look for "Advanced Settings" or "More Options"
- Root Directory field should be there

### Location B: After Service Creation (Most Common)
- Service created ‚Üí Click on service ‚Üí Settings tab ‚Üí Source section ‚Üí Root Directory
