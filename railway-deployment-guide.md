ðŸš„ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - BUDGET PLANNER
===========================================

## ðŸŽ¯ OVERVIEW
Railway deployment is MUCH easier than Render! Everything is already configured for you.

## âœ… WHAT'S READY:
- âœ… `/backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- âœ… `/backend/Dockerfile` - Docker container setup  
- âœ… `/backend/requirements.txt` - All dependencies
- âœ… All your app code is ready

## ðŸš€ STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT:

### Step 1: Sign Up for Railway (2 minutes)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
4. Verify your email if needed

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (5 minutes)

#### 2a. Create New Project
1. Click "New Project" 
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your budget planner repository
4. Railway will detect it's a Python app

#### 2b. Configure Backend Service
1. Railway will create a service automatically
2. It will use your `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml`
3. Wait for the initial build (2-3 minutes)

#### 2c. Set Environment Variables
Click on your service â†’ "Variables" tab â†’ Add these:

```
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SENDER_NAME=Budget Planner
ENABLE_EMAIL_SENDING=true
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE=1440
```

**Required Variables (You need to provide):**
```
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://[your-username]:[your-password]@[your-cluster].mongodb.net/budget_planner?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Buildadatabase

JWT_SECRET=[your-secure-jwt-secret-32-chars-minimum]

SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.[your-sendgrid-api-key]

SENDER_EMAIL=[your-verified-sender-email]

CORS_ORIGINS=["*"]
```

#### 2d. Deploy Backend
1. Click "Deploy" or wait for auto-deployment
2. Watch the build logs
3. Get your backend URL: `https://[service-name].railway.app`

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend (5 minutes)

#### 3a. Add Frontend Service
1. In the same Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" again
3. Choose the same repository
4. Set the "Root Directory" to `frontend`

#### 3b. Configure Frontend Build
Railway should auto-detect, but verify:
- **Build Command**: `yarn install && yarn build`
- **Start Command**: `yarn start`
- **Root Directory**: `frontend`

#### 3c. Set Frontend Environment Variables
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://[your-backend-service].railway.app
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

#### 3d. Update Backend CORS
Go back to backend service variables and update:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://[your-frontend-service].railway.app"]
```

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment (2 minutes)

#### Test Backend:
```
https://[your-backend].railway.app/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`

#### Test Frontend:
```
https://[your-frontend].railway.app
```
Should show your Budget Planner login page

## ðŸŽ‰ ADVANTAGES OF RAILWAY:

âœ… **Much Faster**: Deploy in 15 minutes vs hours of Render troubleshooting  
âœ… **Better Free Tier**: More generous than Render  
âœ… **Automatic HTTPS**: SSL certificates included  
âœ… **Easy Scaling**: One-click upgrades  
âœ… **Great Logs**: Easy debugging  
âœ… **Git Integration**: Auto-deploy on push  

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Build Fails?
1. Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. Verify Dockerfile syntax

### Backend Won't Start?
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify MongoDB connection string
3. Check the application logs

### Frontend Can't Reach Backend?
1. Verify `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is correct
2. Update backend `CORS_ORIGINS` with frontend URL
3. Check both services are deployed and running

## ðŸ’° PRICING:
- **Free Tier**: $5 credit per month (plenty for development)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month for production apps
- **Much better value than Render**
