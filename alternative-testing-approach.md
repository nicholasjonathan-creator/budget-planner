🚨 DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE - ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
==================================================

## ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
MongoDB authentication is failing, which suggests:
- Database credentials may have changed
- MongoDB Atlas access may be restricted
- Connection string may need updating

## 🚀 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION - FRESH TESTING APPROACH:

### Option 1: Test with New User Account
Instead of clearing old data, we can:
1. **Create a new user account** for testing
2. **This user will have zero transactions** (fresh slate)
3. **Test all features** with the new user
4. **Keep existing data** for comparison

### Option 2: Fix Database Connection
If you want to clear existing data:
1. **Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard**
2. **Verify database user credentials**
3. **Ensure IP whitelist includes Railway servers**
4. **Update connection string if needed**
