## 🚀 QUICK ACTIONS:

### Option A: I'll Help You Get Each Variable
Tell me which you need help with:
- **"Help with MongoDB"** - I'll guide you through Atlas setup
- **"Help with SendGrid"** - I'll guide you through API key creation
- **"Generate JWT secret"** - I'll create a secure one for you

### Option B: You Have Some Already  
If you have any of these values, just add them to Railway:
- Click "New Variable" in Railway
- Add Key and Value
- Repeat for each one

### Option C: Use Temporary Values (For Testing)
If you want to test deployment first, you can use these temporary values:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/budget_planner
JWT_SECRET=budget-planner-railway-jwt-secret-2025-temporary-testing-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.temporary-key-for-testing
SENDER_EMAIL=test@example.com
```

**⚠️ These won't work for real functionality, but will let Railway deploy successfully**
