🔍 HOW TO FIND RAILWAY LOGS - STEP BY STEP
==========================================

## 📍 EXACT STEPS TO FIND RAILWAY LOGS:

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Service
1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Click on your backend service** (the one showing "Deploy failed")

### Step 2: Look for These Tabs/Sections
Once you click on your service, you should see tabs at the top. Look for:

**Option A: "Deployments" Tab**
- Click **"Deployments"** 
- You'll see a list of deployments
- Click on the **most recent one** (probably shows failed/red status)
- This should show you the build logs

**Option B: "Logs" Tab**  
- Click **"Logs"** directly
- This shows real-time and historical logs

**Option C: Build Logs Icon**
- Look for a **terminal/console icon** 
- Or a **"View Logs"** button/link
- Click it to see deployment logs

### Step 3: What You're Looking For
In the logs, you'll see text that might include:
- Lines starting with **"ERROR:"**
- Lines in **red text**
- **"Failed"** messages
- **"ModuleNotFoundError"**
- **"Connection refused"**
