The AI engineer's work trajectory revolved around developing and refining a full-stack budget planner MVP. Initially, the focus was on building core features with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. A significant pivot involved implementing automated transaction tracking via SMS parsing for Indian banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal), necessitating extensive regex pattern refinement. Concurrently, the application was prepared for production deployment on Railway/Render and Vercel, integrating with MongoDB Atlas and localizing for INR currency and DD-MM-YYYY dates. Recent efforts concentrated on enhancing the SMS parser's accuracy across diverse bank formats, enabling UI drill-down functionality for financial summaries, and crucially, adding a manual classification feature for unparsed SMS messages. The current challenge involves ensuring the frontend financial summaries dynamically update post-manual classification.

The primary goal was to create a simple budget planner application with core functionalities including income/expense tracking, category-based summaries, monthly charts, and local storage. The UI was specified to be clean, responsive, use pastel colors, and adhere to modern design principles (motion, depth, bold typography, asymmetry).

During development, the requirements expanded to include:
1.  **Automated Transaction Tracking**: Shifted from email to SMS alerts, with a critical need to parse and auto-categorize transactions from various Indian banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, later extended to Axis and Scapia/Federal) using advanced regex.
2.  **Backend Integration**: Transition from mock data to a MongoDB database, implementing comprehensive CRUD operations for transactions, categories, and budgets, ensuring all API endpoints are prefixed with .
3.  **Production Readiness**: Configuring the application for cloud deployment on Railway/Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend), connected to a MongoDB Atlas database. This included creating necessary Dockerfiles and deployment configurations.
4.  **Localization**: Adapting the application for India-specific currency (INR with Indian formatting) and date formats (DD-MM-YYYY).
5.  **Enhanced UI & Manual Classification**: Adding the ability for users to drill down into income/expense totals, and implement a feature to manually classify SMS messages that the automated parser fails to process.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Frontend-backend communication uses REST APIs, with all backend routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress compatibility.



-   : The main FastAPI application, handling API endpoints and CORS. Updated to include endpoints for SMS processing and manual classification.
-   : Defines the Pydantic  model. Modified to include  in the  enum for manual classifications.
-   : Contains business logic for transactions. Modified to correctly handle 0-indexed month from frontend to 1-indexed for backend processing and budget updates.
-   : Newly discovered during development, this file holds the advanced regex patterns for SMS parsing. Heavily modified to improve parsing accuracy for HDFC bank (handling Indian number formats, multiline SMS, payee, and balance extraction), and expanded to support Axis Bank and Scapia/Federal Bank SMS formats. Missing  and  were re-added.
-   : Handles receiving and processing SMS, utilizing . New backend endpoints (, ) were added here to manage failed SMS and their manual classification.
-   : The root React component.
-   : Centralizes API calls. Updated to include new methods (, ) for fetching failed SMS and sending manual classification data.
-   : The main dashboard component. Extensively modified to make Total Income, Total Expenses, and Balance summary cards clickable for drill-down filtering of transactions. Integrated the new  component within a Manual tab and implemented a  state to trigger dashboard data reloads.
-   : Component for demonstrating SMS parsing.
-   : A new component created to provide a UI for users to view failed SMS messages and manually classify them (as debit or credit) by entering amount and description. It includes loading states and feedback mechanisms.
-   : An existing ShadCN UI component confirmed to be present and utilized by the new manual classification feature.
-   : Used extensively to log problem statements, testing protocols, and results.

<current_work>
The budget planner application is fully developed and deployed, offering income/expense tracking, category summaries, and charts. Its core strength is the SMS transaction parser, which now supports HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, and Scapia/Federal bank formats with high accuracy (93.5% success rate on 93 live messages). The application also features Indian localization (INR, DD-MM-YYYY).

Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on resolving a critical UI refresh issue. A **manual classification feature** has been implemented, allowing users to classify SMS messages that failed automatic parsing (the remaining 6.5% of messages). This feature includes:
-   New backend API endpoints ( and ).
-   A dedicated Manual tab and  component in the frontend where users can view failed SMS, input transaction details (type, amount, description), and submit them.
-   The dashboard's financial summary cards (Total Income, Total Expenses, Balance) are now clickable, providing a drill-down feature to filter transactions.

During the implementation of manual classification, an issue where the backend's  enum did not recognize  was identified and fixed in . Backend API calls for transactions and monthly summaries are now validated as correctly working.

However, the **immediate problem being addressed** is that after a user manually classifies an SMS, while the new transaction correctly appears in the Recent Transactions list, the **financial summaries (Total Income, Total Expenses, Balance) on the  do not automatically refresh to reflect these changes**. The engineer has implemented refresh mechanisms, including a  state in  and loading indicators, but the financial totals remain unchanged post-classification. The last action confirms the new transaction appears, but the summary totals do not update, indicating a persistent frontend refresh problem specifically for the financial overview.

<optional_next_step>
Improve the frontend UI refresh mechanism to ensure financial summaries update immediately after manual SMS classification.
