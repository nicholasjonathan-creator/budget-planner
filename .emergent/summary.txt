The previous AI engineer meticulously developed a full-stack budget planner, transitioning it from an MVP to a robust, production-ready application. This involved building the core React, FastAPI, MongoDB stack, then extensively refining an automated SMS parsing system for various Indian banks, ensuring high accuracy. A significant part of the work focused on preparing for cloud deployment and implementing Indian localization. Subsequent efforts concentrated on enhancing user experience through UI drill-down features for financial summaries, a crucial manual classification system for unparsed SMS, dynamic budget counters, and smart date validation. Debugging a persistent UI refresh issue after manual classification was a key challenge, along with implementing multi-currency display. The final phase involved thorough data clearing and preparing the system for comprehensive re-testing with a new set of real-world SMS messages, which is currently underway.

<product_requirements>
The application's core requirement was a simple budget planner for income/expense tracking, category summaries, and monthly charts, featuring a clean, responsive UI with modern design principles. This evolved to include:
1.  **Automated Transaction Tracking**: Parse and auto-categorize transactions from bank SMS (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal) using advanced regex.
2.  **Backend Integration**: Implement MongoDB CRUD operations for transactions, categories, and budgets, with all API endpoints prefixed .
3.  **Production Readiness**: Configure for cloud deployment on Railway/Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) with MongoDB Atlas.
4.  **Localization**: Support INR currency with Indian formatting and DD-MM-YYYY dates.
5.  **Enhanced UI & Manual Classification**: Allow drill-down into income/expense totals for detailed transaction views, and manually classify unparsed SMS, including currency selection.
6.  **Dynamic Budget Counters**: Budget limits should update dynamically.
7.  **Unclassified SMS Visibility**: Display unclassified SMS in a Manual Validation Needed UI section.
8.  **Smart Date Validation**: Prevent processing SMS with illogical dates (e.g., future dates for the current month).
9.  **Full Transaction List on Drill-down**: Ensure clicking income/expense summaries shows all relevant transactions, including original SMS text.
10. **Multi-Currency Display**: Show non-INR transactions in a dedicated UI section.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture with React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database), communicating via REST APIs prefixed with .



-   : The main FastAPI application. New admin endpoints (, ) were added for comprehensive data clearing. The manual classification endpoint () was updated to accept a  field.
-   : Defines the Pydantic  model. Modified to include  in  enum and critically, a new  field was added to the  model to store the transaction's currency.
-   : Contains advanced regex patterns. Heavily modified to improve parsing accuracy for HDFC, Axis, Scapia/Federal, and generic SMS. A new  method was added to parse currency from SMS, and date validation () was integrated across all parsing methods to handle illogical dates.
-   : Manages SMS reception and processing. New backend endpoints (, ) were added.
-   : Centralizes API calls. Updated  to send  data and included  for fetching unparsed messages.
-   : The main dashboard. Modified to make financial summary cards clickable for drill-down.  state was introduced for data reloads. Implemented  state for programmatic tab switching and integrated a Manual Validation Needed alert based on . Added logic to detect and display the  component.
-   : A new component for manual classification. Enhanced to include a dynamic currency dropdown with auto-detection from SMS content (e.g., USD, PHP).
-   : Displays transactions. Rewritten to show detailed SMS information (original text, bank, parsing method) in an expandable/collapsible view. Also shows SMS Auto badges and account numbers.
-   : A new component created to display non-INR transactions, their amounts, and exchange rates in a dedicated UI section.
-   : Used extensively to log problem statements, testing protocols, and results throughout the development and debugging process.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement user authentication and accounts.
-   Add email notifications.
-   Develop a mobile application (PWA or native).
-   Integrate with bank APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, Open Banking) for direct data access.
-   Implement advanced analytics, including spending patterns, budget recommendations, and financial health scores.
-   Set up real SMS webhooks (e.g., Twilio) for production and configure SMS forwarding from a phone.
-   UI adjustment for better tag button visibility in transaction display.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The budget planner is fully functional, offering income/expense tracking, category summaries, charts, and automated SMS transaction parsing (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal banks) with high accuracy. Indian localization (INR, DD-MM-YYYY) and cloud deployment are established.

Currently, the AI engineer has implemented and successfully verified several significant enhancements:
-   **Financial Summary Refresh**: Resolved, ensuring immediate UI updates after manual SMS classification.
-   **Smart Date Validation**: Implemented in SMS parsing, correctly rejecting future/illogical dates (100% success rate).
-   **Manual Classification Enhancement**: The  component now includes a currency dropdown that auto-detects currency from the SMS (e.g., USD, PHP) and allows manual override. This integrates with the backend which now stores the  field in transactions.
-   **Dynamic Budget Counters**: Logic is in place within  to show real-time spent/remaining amounts.
-   **Manual Validation Needed Section**: A prominent UI alert on  displays pending unclassified SMS messages.
-   **Enhanced Drill-down**: Clicking income/expense summary cards now automatically switches to the Transactions tab and displays *all* filtered transactions, including an expandable detailed view showing the original SMS text and parsing metadata.
-   **Multi-Currency Display**: A dedicated section () now appears on the dashboard when non-INR transactions are detected, showing a breakdown by currency and mock exchange rates.

Immediately before this summary, the system underwent a comprehensive data clearing and verification process (including transactions, budget limits, SMS data) to ensure a completely clean state for fresh testing. The backend and frontend were confirmed to show zero data. The last action was the user providing a new set of 20 SMS messages, and the engineer has begun processing them to audit for any mismatches (missed/duplicated entries) from previous tests and confirm all features work with the new data.

<optional_next_step>
Process the provided 20 new SMS messages to fully populate the system and verify all enhanced features with the new dataset, ensuring data integrity.
