The AI engineer's work on the Budget Planner application traversed from enhancing core functionalities to resolving critical deployment and UI issues. Initial efforts established a multi-user application with robust SMS parsing, authentication, and a monitoring system. Key challenges involved persistent frontend-backend synchronization and modal closure issues, which were meticulously debugged and resolved. A comprehensive QA/UAT phase followed, identifying minor UI and API errors, all successfully rectified. A significant product decision was then made to remove SendGrid email features for simplicity.

The subsequent production deployment to Railway and Vercel, while initially successful, exposed critical UI/UX discrepancies in the live environment, such as missing navigation tabs and logout functionality. Despite multiple debugging attempts, including forced Vercel redeployments and manual GitHub changes, these issues persisted, indicating deeper caching or build problems. This led to a pivotal user decision to abandon the current state and initiate a complete fresh start with a new GitHub repository, emphasizing secure handling of sensitive data. The AI engineer has now prepared a comprehensive package and plan for this clean, secure re-implementation.

<product_requirements>
The Budget Planner is a multi-user application for income/expense tracking, category summaries, and charts, featuring a clean UI. It supports automated transaction parsing from bank SMS (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal) and manual entry, with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB. It's production-ready for cloud deployment (Railway/Vercel with MongoDB Atlas), supporting INR currency and DD-MM-YYYY dates.

UI enhancements include financial summary drill-downs, manual classification for unparsed SMS, dynamic budget counters, and visibility for unclassified SMS. A secure user authentication system ensures multi-user data isolation. Enhanced Analytics & Insights with financial health scores and spending trends are integrated. WhatsApp integration allows automated SMS forwarding after phone verification.

Recent agreements for a fresh start include: pop-up confirmation for hard deletion of transactions, support for both custom and predefined budget categories, monthly and weekly budget options, optional WhatsApp flow with manual entry fallback, comprehensive analytics insights, and data export in PDF, CSV, and Excel formats.

<code_architecture>


-   : Main FastAPI application. Enhanced with monitoring API endpoints (), startup/shutdown for . Email-related endpoints were removed/disabled to simplify the app.
-   : Handles incoming WhatsApp messages. Improved date storage consistency, correct parsing of credit messages, and robust handling of Twilio authentication errors. Test-only parsing methods were removed.
-   : Enhances SMS parsing logic, specifically for UPI formats, and correctly identifies incomplete messages for manual classification.
-   : (NEW FILE) Contains core logic for system health checks, failed transaction detection, WhatsApp service monitoring, and email alert generation (email alerts later disabled).
-   : (NEW FILE) Orchestrates periodic monitoring tasks using APScheduler, later adjusted for email disablement.
-   : Updated with new monitoring API methods. Removed  method. Critical fix for duplicate  method (renamed one to ) and correct  usage. Implemented enhanced error handling with increased timeout (10s to 15s) and retry logic for GET requests. Corrected a duplicate  prefix in base URL.
-   : Simplified UI by removing Test SMS Parsing section and consolidating SMS testing into  modal.
-   : Modified to correctly implement modal closure via 'X' button, Escape key, and outside clicks using  prop and handlers.
-   : (NEW FILE) Frontend component to display system health and alerts, consuming new monitoring APIs.
-   : Used extensively for logging test protocols, debugging, and verifying fixes throughout the development process. Cleaned up to remove sensitive data at the end.
-   , , ,  (email endpoints), , , : All email-related backend services, scheduler, API endpoints, and frontend UI components (notification settings, email trigger buttons) were either simplified, disabled, or removed entirely due to the user's decision to deploy without email features.
-   : Modified to correctly display all 9 tabs by adjusting grid columns from  to  for non-admin users. This component also integrates the  and  components.
-   : Contains user profile and logout functionality, though its dropdown visibility was a persistent UI issue.
-   : Confirmed to handle logout functionality correctly.
-   : SendGrid dependencies were removed.
-    and : (NEW FILES) Created to provide secure placeholders for environment variables, ensuring no sensitive data is committed to the repository.
-   : Updated to be security-focused with deployment instructions.
-   : (NEW FILE) Created for step-by-step security verification.
-   , , , : (NEW FILES) Created to document previous errors, the context for the fresh start, the new deployment plan, and the final status for a seamless handover to a new session/repository.

<pending_tasks>
- Develop a mobile application (PWA or native).
- Integrate with bank APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, Open Banking) for direct data access.
- Implement further advanced analytics features (beyond current insights).
- UI adjustment for better tag button visibility in transaction display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was grappling with persistent UI display issues on the production Vercel frontend, specifically the non-appearance of the user profile/logout button and several critical navigation tabs (Analytics, Notifications, WhatsApp, Monitoring). Despite verifying the codebase, applying fixes (e.g., adjusting tab grid columns, ensuring  integration), restarting services, and forcing Vercel redeployments, these UI problems persisted, suggesting underlying caching or build propagation issues.

This led to the user requesting a complete fresh start of the project from scratch, including a new GitHub repository, to circumvent these unresolved deployment and synchronization challenges. The AI engineer's current work (and the last actions in the trajectory) involved meticulously preparing a complete package for this new session. This package includes a cleaned codebase free of sensitive data, comprehensive documentation of all past errors and their prevention strategies (), a detailed fresh deployment plan (), and a handoff document (, ) to ensure a seamless transition and successful re-implementation of all agreed-upon features in the new environment.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to initiate the new session by forking the provided clean code package to a new GitHub repository and then proceeding with Phase 1 of the fresh deployment plan.
