The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the Budget Planner application from initial setup to a functional state, including crucial production deployments and Twilio WhatsApp integration. Initial efforts focused on debugging deployment failures across Railway and Render, addressing environment variables, Dockerfiles, and Python dependencies. A key decision was removing all email functionalities to streamline the application, resolving a persistent user registration issue. The process culminated in stable frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) deployments, enabling core features and Twilio-powered transaction parsing.

Subsequent work involved implementing significant feature enhancements across two phases: Account Consolidation, Password Reset, SMS Duplicate Detection (Phase 1), and Account Deletion, Phone Number Management, SMS Management (Phase 2). Throughout these phases, the engineer meticulously debugged build failures (Vercel import paths,  context), runtime errors ( vs ), and critical production issues (backend  flag causing instability). The current state involves addressing lingering frontend issues related to authentication session management and the visibility of account deletion options, where the  is identified as a potential root cause.

<product_requirements>
The Budget Planner is a multi-user application for tracking income/expenses, summarizing categories, and visualizing data via charts through a user-friendly UI. It automates transaction parsing from bank SMS (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal) and supports manual entry. The application utilizes a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, handles INR currency, DD-MM-YYYY dates, and is deployable on cloud platforms like Railway/Vercel with MongoDB Atlas. Key UI enhancements include financial summary drill-downs, manual classification for unparsed SMS, dynamic budget counters, and visibility for unclassified SMS. It features a secure user authentication system ensuring data isolation. Planned features include enhanced analytics, WhatsApp integration for SMS forwarding (post phone verification), pop-up confirmation for hard deletion of transactions, custom and predefined budget categories, monthly/weekly budget options, an optional WhatsApp flow with manual entry fallback, comprehensive analytics insights, and data export in PDF, CSV, and Excel formats.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on diagnosing and fixing critical issues reported by the user following comprehensive frontend testing. The primary issues were:
1.  **Authentication Session Management Failure:** Users were getting stuck on Logging in..., and authentication-related tests were failing. This was previously traced to a backend timeout issue caused by the  flag in the  file, which was successfully fixed, making the backend stable. However, frontend authentication issues persist, leading to the current investigation.
2.  **Account Deletion Options Visibility Problem:** The soft and hard delete options for account deletion were not appearing in the frontend UI.
3.  **Sync Check Failed Message:** This was appearing in the UI. The underlying cause was found to be an incorrect API client usage ( instead of ) within the  method in , which has been corrected.

The very last action taken by the previous engineer was to investigate the authentication session management issue by examining . The engineer identified that  is currently making direct  API calls instead of utilizing the centralized , which could be the root cause of the inconsistent authentication behavior and related problems. The trajectory ends with the engineer planning to investigate how the  handles authentication.
