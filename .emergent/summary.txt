<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP budget planner into a feature-rich application. Key achievements include a highly accurate SMS parsing system, cloud deployment readiness, Indian localization, and advanced UI features like drill-down summaries, manual classification with currency detection, dynamic budget counters, and multi-currency display. A critical SMS parsing bug was identified and fixed, ensuring correct extraction of transaction amounts from ICICI SMS, differentiating from Avl Limit. Subsequently, a robust user authentication system was implemented, followed by a comprehensive email notification system with SendGrid integration and automated background jobs. The work then shifted to production deployment to Render, facing and resolving service naming conflicts and a  build issue. The last interaction identified a GitHub Secret Protection issue while trying to save files containing sensitive data.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a budget planner for income/expense tracking, category summaries, and monthly charts with a clean UI. It evolved to include:
1.  **Automated Transaction Tracking**: Parsing and auto-categorizing transactions from bank SMS (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Scapia/Federal) using advanced regex.
2.  **Backend Integration**: MongoDB CRUD for transactions, categories, budgets, with all API endpoints prefixed .
3.  **Production Readiness**: Configuration for cloud deployment on Railway/Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) with MongoDB Atlas.
4.  **Localization**: Support for INR currency with Indian formatting and DD-MM-YYYY dates.
5.  **Enhanced UI & Manual Classification**: Drill-down into financial summaries, manual classification of unparsed SMS including currency selection.
6.  **Dynamic Budget Counters**: Budget limits update dynamically.
7.  **Unclassified SMS Visibility**: Display unclassified SMS in a Manual Validation Needed UI section.
8.  **Smart Date Validation**: Prevent processing SMS with illogical dates.
9.  **Full Transaction List on Drill-down**: Show all relevant transactions, including original SMS text.
10. **Multi-Currency Display**: Show non-INR transactions in a dedicated UI section.
11. **User Authentication System**: Implement secure user registration, login, and data isolation.
12. **Email Notifications**: Implement various email alerts (welcome, budget, summaries, transaction confirmations, SMS reports).
13. **Production Email Automation**: Set up background jobs for scheduled emails.
14. **Production Deployment**: Implement robust deployment to cloud platforms like Render.

<current_work>
The budget planner application is now a multi-user, production-ready system with comprehensive features. All initial product requirements, including advanced SMS parsing (with a recent critical fix for ICICI Avl Limit misparsing), multi-currency display, and enhanced UI drill-downs, are implemented and verified.

The AI engineer has successfully implemented:
-   **User Authentication System**: Secure user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, protected routes, and user data isolation are fully functional on both backend and frontend. An admin user () was manually created in the database for testing administrative features.
-   **Email Notification System**: Integration with SendGrid, comprehensive user notification preferences, and various email types (welcome, budget alerts, summaries, etc.) are implemented and tested successfully.
-   **Production Email Automation**: Background jobs for scheduled emails (daily, weekly, monthly summaries, budget alerts, health checks) are configured using APScheduler, running in the backend. An admin-only frontend interface () allows monitoring and control of the scheduler.
-   **Production Deployment Setup (Render)**: Configuration files (, , ), deployment scripts, and checklists for Render have been generated.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was guiding the user through the Render deployment process. A service name conflict ( was already in use) was encountered and resolved by generating unique service names (e.g., , ). A  build error on the frontend during Render deployment was identified and fixed by adjusting the build command to ensure  are installed (yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...

yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.). The frontend build was shown to be successful and was in the deploying phase.

During the frontend deployment wait, the user provided a new batch of 20+ SMS messages for testing. The very last action was the system reporting a GitHub Secret Protection error, indicating sensitive data (API keys, URLs) in files that are attempting to be saved or committed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to address the GitHub Secret Protection error by removing sensitive data from the code.
