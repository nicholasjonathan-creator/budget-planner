The AI engineer's work trajectory focused on building a full-stack budget planner MVP. Initially, a React frontend was developed using mock data, followed by FastAPI backend implementation with MongoDB for data persistence. A key pivot occurred when the user requested automated transaction tracking via SMS parsing, which was then prioritized and implemented for Indian banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI). The final phase concentrated on production readiness, involving setting up deployment configurations for Railway/Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend), connecting to MongoDB Atlas, and fine-tuning the application for Indian localization (INR currency, DD-MM-YYYY date format). Throughout, debugging involved screenshot analysis, log checks, and iterative code adjustments, particularly for date handling and refining the SMS parser based on real user feedback and examples. The project successfully reached a fully deployed, production-ready state with core features implemented.

The primary objective was to build a simple budget planner application. Core functionalities include income/expense tracking, category-based summaries, monthly charts, and local storage. The UI was specified to be clean, responsive, use pastel colors, and have easy input forms, adhering to modern design guidelines including motion, depth, bold typography, and asymmetry.

During development, the requirements evolved to include:
1.  **Automated Transaction Tracking**: Initially via email (Gmail/Outlook), then shifted to SMS alerts due to user preference and perceived directness. The SMS parsing was to handle multiple Indian bank formats (HDFC, SBI, ICICI) and auto-categorize transactions.
2.  **Backend Integration**: Transition from mock data to a real database (MongoDB), implementing essential CRUD operations for transactions, categories, and budgets, with proper API prefixing ().
3.  **Production Readiness**: Preparing the application for deployment to cloud platforms (Railway/Render for backend, Vercel for frontend) with a MongoDB Atlas database. This included creating Dockerfiles, Railway/Vercel configurations, and deployment scripts.
4.  **Localization**: Adapting the application for India-specific currency (INR with Indian formatting) and date formats (DD-MM-YYYY) based on user feedback.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Communication between frontend and backend occurs via REST APIs, with all backend routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress compatibility.



-   : The main FastAPI application. It includes the  for all API endpoints, defines Pydantic models for , and handles CORS. It was updated to include transaction and SMS parsing endpoints and integrate with MongoDB.
-   , , : New files defining the Pydantic data models for the MongoDB collections. These are crucial for structuring the application's data.
-   : Contains the core logic for processing transactions, including the advanced regex patterns for parsing various bank SMS formats. This file encapsulates the business logic for transaction management.
-   : The root React component. It sets up  for navigation. Initially a placeholder, it was updated to integrate the  and other components. Changes involved removing placeholder API calls and ensuring routing.
-   : Created to provide mock data for initial frontend development, allowing the UI to be built and tested independently before backend integration.
-   : A new file that centralizes all API calls from the frontend to the backend, using . This file abstracts API endpoint details, making frontend components cleaner and easier to manage.
-   : The main dashboard component displaying financial summaries, charts, and transaction overviews. This file underwent extensive modifications to fetch data from the real backend API, handle dynamic date filtering, display INR currency, and correct date formatting.
-   : A new component added to the frontend specifically for demonstrating the SMS parsing functionality. It allows users to simulate SMS inputs and see immediate results.
-   , , , : These components were updated to consume data from the  service, replacing mock data usage. They also incorporated the INR currency and Indian date formatting changes.
-   , , : Configuration files for Docker, Railway (backend deployment), and Vercel (frontend deployment), respectively. These are essential for containerization and automated deployment pipelines.
-   , : Environment specific files for production configurations, preventing hardcoding of sensitive information.
-   Various markdown files (, , , etc.): Created to provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for manual cloud deployment.

<current_work>
The budget planner application is fully developed and deployed to the internet. The backend is hosted on Render, and the frontend on Vercel, both connected to a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. The application successfully provides income/expense tracking, category-based summaries, and interactive charts. A key feature is the SMS transaction parsing, which automatically extracts and categorizes financial data from bank SMS alerts, with support for HDFC, SBI, and ICICI formats. The application has been localized for India, displaying amounts in INR (â‚¹) with Indian number formatting and dates in DD-MM-YYYY format.

Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on improving the accuracy of the SMS parser. The user has provided new, real-world HDFC bank SMS examples that previously caused parsing failures. The task is to specifically customize the existing regex patterns within the  to correctly extract the amount, date/time, payee (merchant/person), and bank from these new real-world message formats. The engineer has already made several edits to the  and is preparing to test these new parsing rules locally.
