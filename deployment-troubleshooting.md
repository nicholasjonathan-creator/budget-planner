üö® DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
===================================

## Current Issue: Services Not Responding

Both backend and frontend services are not responding, which suggests deployment issues.

## Possible Causes & Solutions:

### 1. ‚ùå Service Names Mismatch
**Problem**: The deployed service names might be different from what we configured
**Solution**: 
- Check your Render dashboard for actual service names
- Services might be named differently than `budget-planner-fe-20250726-1342`

### 2. ‚ùå Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Render services need environment variables to start properly
**Backend Required Variables**:
- MONGO_URL (your MongoDB Atlas connection string)
- JWT_SECRET (a secure random string)
- SENDGRID_API_KEY (your SendGrid API key)
- SENDER_EMAIL (your verified sender email)

**Frontend Required Variables**:
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL (should point to your backend service)

### 3. ‚ùå Build Failures
**Problem**: Services might have failed to build
**Backend Issues**:
- Missing Python dependencies
- Database connection failures
- Invalid environment variables

**Frontend Issues**:
- Missing `@craco/craco` dependency (should be fixed now)
- Build errors in React code
- Invalid environment variables

## üîß Immediate Actions Needed:

### Step 1: Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Check the actual service names (they might be different)
3. Look for any deployment error messages
4. Check build and deploy logs

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Render backend service:
```
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://your-actual-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-actual-jwt-secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-actual-sendgrid-key
SENDER_EMAIL=your-verified-sender-email
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration If Needed
If your service names are different, update:
- `/app/frontend/.env` - REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
- `/app/render.yaml` - service names and URLs
- `/app/frontend/_redirects` - backend URL

## üîç Quick Diagnostic Commands:

1. Check if services exist with different names:
   ```bash
   # Try common naming patterns:
   curl -I https://budget-planner-backend-random.onrender.com/api/health
   curl -I https://budget-planner-frontend-random.onrender.com
   ```

2. Test with your original service names if different

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Next Steps:

1. **Check Render Dashboard**: Look for actual service names and error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Check Build Logs**: Look for build/deployment failures
4. **Update URLs**: If service names are different, update configuration

## üìû If You Need Help:

Please share:
1. Actual service names from your Render dashboard
2. Any error messages from build/deploy logs
3. Current status of environment variables

This will help me provide more specific troubleshooting steps.
