ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Backend experiencing severe timeout issues. DETAILED FINDINGS: ❌ Health endpoint timeout (>10s), ❌ Login endpoint timeout (>10s), ❌ Pat's login timeout (>10s), ❌ Performance analysis shows 3/3 requests timed out (>15s). IMPACT: This explains why user 'Pat' is stuck on 'Logging in...' and login is not completing. BACKEND STATUS: Backend is accessible but extremely slow, causing all authentication requests to timeout. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: 1. Check backend server resources and performance, 2. Verify database connectivity and query performance, 3. Implement request timeout handling on frontend, 4. Add retry logic for failed login attempts. SUCCESS RATE: 0% (All login tests timed out). DEPLOYMENT STATUS: CRITICAL - Backend performance issues preventing user authentication."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL LOGIN ISSUE DISCOVERED FOR USER 'PAT': Conducted comprehensive login investigation at https://budget-planner-backendjuly.onrender.com as requested in review. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Backend experiencing severe timeout issues preventing login completion. DETAILED FINDINGS: ❌ Health endpoint timeout (>10s), ❌ Login endpoint timeout (>10s), ❌ All authentication requests timing out (>15s), ❌ Performance analysis shows 100% failure rate (3/3 requests timed out). IMPACT ANALYSIS: This explains why user 'Pat' is stuck on 'Logging in...' and login is not completing. The backend is accessible but extremely slow, causing all authentication requests to timeout before completion. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED: 1. Check backend server resources and performance metrics, 2. Verify database connectivity and query performance, 3. Implement request timeout handling on frontend, 4. Add retry logic for failed login attempts, 5. Consider backend scaling or optimization. CRITICAL PRIORITY: This is a production-blocking issue affecting all users attempting to login. RECOMMENDATION: Address backend performance issues immediately before user 'Pat' can successfully complete login process."
