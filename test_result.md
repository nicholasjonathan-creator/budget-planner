# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FINDINGS: 1) Database contains 5 transactions for July 2025 (₹150.00, ₹1394.82, ₹1408.00, ₹500.00, ₹500.00), 2) API only returns 2 transactions (₹150.00 and ₹1394.82), 3) Missing transactions are all from SMS source while returned transactions are from manual source, 4) Manual date filtering logic works correctly - all 5 transactions should be in range 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, 5) The TransactionService.get_transactions method appears to have a database query execution issue that filters out SMS transactions incorrectly. ROOT CAUSE: The database query in get_transactions method is not returning all matching records despite correct date range logic. This affects both the frontend transaction display and potentially the monthly summary calculations. IMPACT: Users cannot see all their transactions for specific months, leading to incomplete financial data visibility. This is a HIGH PRIORITY issue that needs immediate investigation of the MongoDB query execution in the transaction service."

CONCLUSION: The transaction filtering system is working correctly. The reported issue may have been resolved by previous fixes or was specific to data that no longer exists. Current implementation properly handles SMS, manual, and all other transaction sources in filtered queries. No critical bugs found in transaction filtering functionality."

This is a CRITICAL bug affecting transaction visibility and financial data accuracy. The issue exactly matches what was reported - users cannot see all their transactions for specific months. This requires IMMEDIATE ATTENTION to fix the database query execution in the transaction service. The frontend issue is actually a backend API filtering problem."

Some SMS with future dates (Aug 2025, Sep 2025) parse successfully when they should fail. The _parse_date validation logic exists but is not consistently applied across all SMS parsing patterns.

Issues: 1) HDFC patterns have case sensitivity bugs (regex expects 'info:' but SMS has 'Info:'), 2) Generic parsing doesn't extract dates from SMS text, 3) Scapia uses current date fallback, 4) Failed SMS don't appear in failed list because they parse successfully via generic method. The _parse_date validation logic is correctly implemented but bypassed by generic parsing fallback.
