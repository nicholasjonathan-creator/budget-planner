OVERALL RESULTS: 11.8% success rate (2/17 tests passed) with critical implementation issues detected. PHASE 2 FEATURE STATUS: ❌ Account Deletion Endpoints: 50.0% success - preview and soft delete working, hard delete and export failed, ❌ Phone Number Management Endpoints: 0.0% success - all endpoints not accessible or not implemented, ❌ Enhanced SMS Management: 0.0% success - all SMS management endpoints not accessible. ✅ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM: Working perfectly - user registration, login, and protected routes functional. CRITICAL FINDINGS: The backend authentication is working correctly, but most Phase 2 specific endpoints are either not implemented or not accessible at the current backend URL (https://0767e749-6846-4863-a163-29d316dc927d.preview.emergentagent.com). Only account deletion preview and soft delete endpoints are working. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED: 1) Verify Phase 2 endpoints are deployed to the correct backend URL, 2) Implement or fix phone number management endpoints (/api/phone/status, /api/phone/initiate-change, etc.), 3) Implement or fix enhanced SMS management endpoints (/api/sms/list, /api/sms/find-duplicates, etc.), 4) Fix hard delete and data export functionality in account deletion service. The backend infrastructure is solid but Phase 2 features need proper deployment and implementation."
