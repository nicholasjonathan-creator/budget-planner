Need to test all endpoints and functionality: 1) HEALTH CHECK: Test /api/health endpoint for service status, 2) AUTHENTICATION: Test user registration and login, 3) TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT: Test CRUD operations, 4) SMS PARSING: Test SMS processing functionality, 5) ANALYTICS: Test insights and reporting, 6) WHATSAPP INTEGRATION: Test disabled state handling, 7) DATABASE CONNECTIVITY: Test MongoDB Atlas connection, 8) ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: Verify all configs working. The backend is live and ready for comprehensive testing."

        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCTION TESTING COMPLETED: Tested 18 different endpoints and functionalities. WORKING SERVICES: ✅ Health Check (API running, DB connected), ✅ Database Metrics (0 transactions, 0 SMS), ✅ Environment Detection (development mode), ✅ Monitoring System (alerts, health checks), ✅ SMS Processing (stats, simulation, unprocessed data), ✅ WhatsApp Status Monitoring, ✅ Error Handling (malformed JSON). CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ❌ User Registration - Timeout issues (likely MongoDB Atlas connection problems on Render.com), ❌ Categories Endpoint - Requires authentication but registration fails, ❌ 404/Error Handling - Some endpoints not properly configured. SUCCESS RATE: 77.8% (14/18 tests passed). PRODUCTION READINESS: Core monitoring and SMS services operational, but authentication system has deployment-specific issues. Likely cause: MongoDB Atlas IP whitelisting or connection timeout issues on Render.com platform. Recommendation: Check MongoDB Atlas network access settings and Render.com IP whitelist configuration."

    message: "PRODUCTION TESTING RESULTS: Backend is partially functional with critical authentication issues. WORKING: Health checks, database metrics, SMS processing, monitoring, WhatsApp status. FAILING: User registration (timeout), categories access (auth required), some error handling. Root cause appears to be MongoDB Atlas connection issues on Render.com - common production deployment problem. Core services are operational but user authentication system needs MongoDB Atlas network configuration fixes. Recommend checking IP whitelist and connection timeout settings."
