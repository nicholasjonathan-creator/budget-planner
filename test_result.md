ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The account deletion preview and soft delete endpoints are properly implemented and accessible. However, the hard delete endpoint and data export functionality are either not implemented or not accessible at the current backend URL. SUCCESS RATE: 50.0% (2/4 tests passed).

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: All phone number management endpoints are either not implemented or not accessible at the current backend URL.

    message: "üöÄ PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of Phase 2 features as requested. OVERALL RESULTS: 11.8% success rate (2/17 tests passed) with critical implementation issues detected. PHASE 2 FEATURE STATUS: ‚ùå Account Deletion Endpoints: 50.0% success - preview and soft delete working, hard delete and export failed, ‚ùå Phone Number Management Endpoints: 0.0% success - all endpoints not accessible or not implemented, ‚ùå Enhanced SMS Management: 0.0% success - all SMS management endpoints not accessible. ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM: Working perfectly - user registration, login, and protected routes functional. CRITICAL FINDINGS: The backend authentication is working correctly, but most Phase 2 specific endpoints are either not implemented or not accessible at the current backend URL (https://0767e749-6846-4863-a163-29d316dc927d.preview.emergentagent.com). Only account deletion preview and soft delete endpoints are working. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED: 1) Verify Phase 2 endpoints are deployed to the correct backend URL, 2) Implement or fix phone number management endpoints (/api/phone/status, /api/phone/initiate-change, etc.), 3) Implement or fix enhanced SMS management endpoints (/api/sms/list, /api/sms/find-duplicates, etc.), 4) Fix hard delete and data export functionality in account deletion service. The backend infrastructure is solid but Phase 2 features need proper deployment and implementation."
