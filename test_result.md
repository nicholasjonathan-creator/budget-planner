user_problem_statement: "Verify that the critical fixes for user 'Pat' testing are now working in production at https://budget-planner-backendjuly.onrender.com: Phone Verification Fix (test phone verification endpoints work correctly, verify method name fix send_verification_otp vs send_verification_code, test phone number change flow), SMS Stats Fix (test GET /api/sms/stats endpoint now requires authentication, verify it returns user-specific statistics instead of system-wide, test that it shows personal SMS count not system total), SMS Display Fix (test SMS list endpoint returns user-specific messages, verify SMS filtering works correctly, test SMS management functionality). Expected Results: Phone verification should send OTP codes properly, SMS stats should show user-specific data (not system-wide 93), SMS display should show only user's messages, all endpoints should work with proper authentication."
