        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCTION TESTING COMPLETED: Tested 18 different endpoints and functionalities. WORKING SERVICES: ✅ Health Check (API running, DB connected), ✅ Database Metrics (0 transactions, 0 SMS), ✅ Environment Detection (development mode), ✅ Monitoring System (alerts, health checks), ✅ SMS Processing (stats, simulation, unprocessed data), ✅ WhatsApp Status Monitoring, ✅ Error Handling (malformed JSON). CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ❌ User Registration - Timeout issues (likely MongoDB Atlas connection problems on Render.com), ❌ Categories Endpoint - Requires authentication but registration fails, ❌ 404/Error Handling - Some endpoints not properly configured. SUCCESS RATE: 77.8% (14/18 tests passed). PRODUCTION READINESS: Core monitoring and SMS services operational, but authentication system has deployment-specific issues. Likely cause: MongoDB Atlas IP whitelisting or connection timeout issues on Render.com platform. Recommendation: Check MongoDB Atlas network access settings and Render.com IP whitelist configuration."

        comment: "FOCUSED AUTHENTICATION TESTING AFTER MONGODB ATLAS USER ROLE UPDATE: Conducted detailed testing of authentication system and database operations. POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS: ✅ MongoDB Atlas Connection Stability (100% stable across 5 tests, avg response time 0.31s), ✅ Database Health Check (DB connected, fast response times). PERSISTENT ISSUES: ❌ User Registration still failing with 500 server error and 'Registration failed' message (0.38s response time - not timeout), ❌ Categories endpoint correctly requires authentication (403 'Not authenticated') but cannot test with auth due to registration failure. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The MongoDB Atlas user role update resolved connection stability issues, but user registration is failing at the application level with a generic 'Registration failed' error. This suggests the issue is not with database connectivity but with the user creation logic or validation in the backend code. The authentication system cannot be fully tested until registration works. RECOMMENDATION: Investigate backend user registration logic, check for validation errors, database constraints, or service dependencies that might be causing the registration failure."

    message: "PRODUCTION TESTING RESULTS: Backend is partially functional with critical authentication issues. WORKING: Health checks, database metrics, SMS processing, monitoring, WhatsApp status. FAILING: User registration (timeout), categories access (auth required), some error handling. Root cause appears to be MongoDB Atlas connection issues on Render.com - common production deployment problem. Core services are operational but user authentication system needs MongoDB Atlas network configuration fixes. Recommend checking IP whitelist and connection timeout settings."

    message: "MONGODB ATLAS USER ROLE UPDATE TESTING RESULTS: The MongoDB Atlas user role permissions update has PARTIALLY RESOLVED the issues. ✅ IMPROVEMENTS: Database connection stability is now excellent (100% stable, fast response times), MongoDB Atlas connectivity issues are resolved. ❌ PERSISTENT ISSUES: User registration still fails with 'Registration failed' error (not timeout-related), preventing full authentication system testing. The issue has shifted from database connectivity problems to application-level registration logic failures. Categories endpoint correctly requires authentication but cannot be tested due to registration failure. NEXT STEPS: The main agent should investigate the backend user registration code logic, validation rules, and any service dependencies that might be causing the registration to fail at the application level rather than database level."
