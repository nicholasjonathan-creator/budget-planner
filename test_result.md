# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fix financial summary refresh issue where Total Income, Total Expenses, and Balance cards on BudgetDashboard do not automatically update after manual SMS classification. Additionally, implement enhanced features: 1) Dynamic budget counters that update as transactions are tagged, 2) Separate 'Manual Validation Needed' section in UI for unclassified SMS, 3) Enhanced drill-down feature for income/expense totals with detailed SMS transaction breakdown, 4) Smart date validation to detect illogical SMS dates and route them to manual validation, 5) Overall error-free functionality."

Tested complete manual SMS classification flow end-to-end: 1) Manual classification creates transactions correctly with proper dates (current month/year), 2) Monthly summary API (/api/analytics/monthly-summary) returns accurate data including new transactions immediately, 3) No caching or timing issues detected - summaries update instantly, 4) Month/year conversion between frontend (0-indexed) and backend (1-indexed) works perfectly, 5) Manual classification creates transactions in correct date range for selected month. All 4 comprehensive tests passed with 100% success rate. The backend implementation is solid and working as expected."

        comment: "IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE: The useEffect dependency array was missing 'refreshKey'. Added refreshKey to useEffect dependencies so that when manual classification increments refreshKey, the useEffect triggers and calls loadData() to refresh all data including monthlySummary. Backend testing confirmed APIs work perfectly - issue was frontend refresh mechanism."

The fix implemented by main agent (adding refreshKey to useEffect dependency array) has resolved the issue completely. Currency handling note: Found '$' symbol in UI - consider enhancement for non-INR currencies."
