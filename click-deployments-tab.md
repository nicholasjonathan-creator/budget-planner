🌐 FIND URL - CLICK "DEPLOYMENTS" TAB
===================================

## 📍 YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE - WRONG TAB

Perfect! I can see you're in your `budget-planner` service settings. The URL isn't shown in the Settings tab though.

## 🎯 CLICK THE "DEPLOYMENTS" TAB

**At the top of the page, I can see these tabs:**
- **Deployments** ← Click this one!
- Variables  
- Metrics
- Settings (you're currently here)

## 🔍 WHY DEPLOYMENTS TAB?

The **Deployments** tab shows:
- ✅ Your service URL/domain
- ✅ Deployment history
- ✅ Live status
- ✅ Public endpoint

## 🎯 ACTION NEEDED:

1. **Click on the "Deployments" tab** (first tab at the top)
2. **Look for your service URL** (should be prominently displayed)
3. **Copy the URL** (something like `https://budget-planner-xyz.railway.app`)

## 🌐 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

After clicking Deployments, you should see:
- Your live deployment with a URL
- Status showing "Live" or "Running"
- **The public URL for your backend**

**Click on that "Deployments" tab now and look for your service URL! 🎯**
