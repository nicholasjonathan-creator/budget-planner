üîß GO TO SETTINGS TAB - FIX BUILD COMMAND
=======================================

## üìç YOU'RE IN BUILD LOGS - NEED TO GO TO SETTINGS

I can see you're looking at the Build Logs tab, but we need to fix the build configuration in Settings.

## üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### Step 1: Go to Settings Tab
**At the top of your screen, I can see tabs:**
- Details
- Build Logs (you're here now)
- Deploy Logs  
- **‚Üê Click "Settings" tab (might not be visible, look for it)**

**OR go back to your service main page:**
1. **Close this log view** (click X)
2. **Go to your service main page**
3. **Click "Settings" tab**

### Step 2: Find Build Settings
**In Settings, look for:**
- **"Build Command"** section
- **"Deploy"** section  
- **"Source"** section

### Step 3: Update Build Command
**Change from:**
```
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```
**To:**
```
yarn install && yarn build
```

### Step 4: Set Root Directory
**Also in Settings:**
- **Root Directory:** `frontend`

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables
**Add these 3 variables:**
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://budget-planner-production-9d40.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION:

**You need to get to Settings tab to fix the build command.**

**Tell me:**
- **"I'm in Settings now"** - Perfect! Look for Build Command
- **"I can't find Settings tab"** - I'll help you navigate there
- **"I see the Build Command field"** - Great! Update it to remove --frozen-lockfile

**The error won't fix until you change the build command in Settings! üîß**
