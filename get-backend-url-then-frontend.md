üéØ FIND YOUR BACKEND URL + FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT
============================================

## üìç STEP 1: GET YOUR BACKEND URL

### Where to Find Your Backend URL in Railway:
1. **In your Railway dashboard**
2. **Click on your backend service** (the one that's now showing "Live" or "Running")
3. **Look for the URL** - it should be prominently displayed, something like:
   ```
   https://budget-planner-638dff0.railway.app
   ```
   OR
   ```
   https://web-production-abc123.up.railway.app
   ```

### Common Places the URL Appears:
- **At the top of the service page**
- **In a "Public URL" section**
- **Next to a globe icon üåê**
- **In the service overview/summary**

## üöÄ STEP 2: FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT PLAN

Once I have your backend URL, here's what we'll do:

### Frontend Deployment Process (5 minutes):
1. **Add Frontend Service** to Railway
2. **Set Frontend Environment Variables:**
   - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=[your-backend-url]`
   - `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`
3. **Configure Frontend Settings:**
   - Root directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `yarn install && yarn build`
   - Start command: `yarn start`
4. **Deploy Frontend**
5. **Update Backend CORS** to allow frontend URL
6. **Test Full Application**

## üîç WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW:

**Please:**
1. **Find your backend URL in Railway**
2. **Copy it exactly**  
3. **Tell me:** "Backend URL is: https://[your-exact-url]"

**OR if you can't find it:**
- **Take a screenshot** of your Railway backend service page
- **Tell me:** "Can't find the URL"

## üéØ EXAMPLE:

If your URL is `https://budget-planner-638dff0.railway.app`, tell me:
**"Backend URL is: https://budget-planner-638dff0.railway.app"**

**Once I have your backend URL, I'll guide you through the 5-minute frontend deployment process! What's your backend URL? üåê**
